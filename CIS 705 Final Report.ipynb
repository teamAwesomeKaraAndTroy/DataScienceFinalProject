    "### Weather Anomalies Over Time\n",
    "We started analyzing the Smart Yields dataset with an initial interest in analyzing the effect weather anomalies have on crop yields over time after learning about the work of Vincent Kimura and Axel Holland for their startup. In an attempt to help them build stronger models, we wanted to provide insights into what variables may be important indicators in identifying impending frost. However, we realized that after plotting the Smart Yields time series, the data only spanned from March 27th of this year until May 8th. We needed to augment the data to develop a more robust dataset, which would give us an opportunity to use the techniques we learned in CIS 705. \n",
    "\n",
    "Smart Yields included data on apples. Fruit trees are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in weather, so we decided that choosing fruit tree crops, in particular, might show a relatively high amount of variation and make for an interesting project. We knew we wanted to analyze the impact of weather on fruit trees over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The appeal of citrus\n",
    "For ease of modeling, we simplified it one step further and selected citrus. The three broad categories of citrus crops that we decided to focus on were oranges, grapefruit, and lemons. This choice was was primarily due to the data that was available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided that citrus trees would make for an interesting study crop, as citrus trees are susceptible to extremes in temperature, since because they do not hibernate or shed leaves in winter. Also, [per capita consumption of oranges is higher than that any other fruit](https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/fruits/citrus/citrus-profile/). Finally, the citrus industry has large economic contributions. For instance, it adds an [annual seven billion dollars to the California economy](https://www.westernfarmpress.com/fruit/citrus-pumps-71-billion-through-californias-economy) alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting California\n",
    "Due to this economic impact in California, as well as the variety and volume of citrus produced in the state, we decided to focus on California as a case study for our exploration of the effects of weather on citrus production. California is also one of the top four citrus producing states in the nation, alongside Texas, Arizona, and Florida. \n",

We acquired our citrus crop data from a collection of these Fruit Tree Yearbook tables that look at bearing acreage, and yield per acre, for a time series ranging from 1980 through 2018. The citrus crop tables contained aggregated data for lemons, oranges, and grapefruit, for the states of California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida.\n",

[An article on citrus production in California (page 2)](https://apps1.cdfa.ca.gov/FertilizerResearch/docs/Citrus_Production_CA.pdf) revealed that the counties of Kern, Fresno, Tulare, Ventura, and Riverside as being the top producers of citrus in the state of California, we decided to pull weather readings from stations in each of these five counties. The [Local Climatological Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd) tool at the NCDC's website allowed us to pull hourly station readings, of temperature and relative humidity, from each of these five counties, spanning a time series from 2000 - 2018. The data came in the form of .csv files, which made them easy to process, but there was a significant delay between requesting the data, and when the data was actually served to us. Of that weather data, we decided to focus only on readings of hourly dry bulb temperature, and hourly relative humidity."

    "\n",
    "While the agricultural data gathered from the USDA was in .csv files, the organization of the data within these files was awkward, which necessitated the use of a custom python script to convert the data into rows that could easily be processed and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the agricultural data came in the form of a yearly time series of aggregate yield per acre and bearing acreage, the weather data consisted of raw station readings recorded at hourly intervals. Therefore, in order to match the weather data with the agricultural data on the same temporal scale, we needed to aggregate the hourly weather station readings into daily, monthly, and yearly summary statistics. We generated the following summary statistics for temperature and humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The average, min, and max temperature and relative humidity readings for each year.\n",
    "- Temperature range (max - min)\n",
    "- Number of days with temperatures 10 degrees above the yearly average, by year\n",
    "- Number of days with temperatures 10 degrees below the yearly average, by year\n",
    "- Number of days with minimum temperatures below 32 degrees, by year\n",
    "- Number of days with minimum temperatures within 3 degrees of the monthly minimum, in months with extreme lows, by year\n",
    "- Number of days with temperatures 7 degrees above the monthly average, by year\n",
    "- Number of days with temperatures 7 degrees below the monthly average, by year\n",

    "## Noticing Trends in Texas | How are crops affected by freezing temperatures?\n",
    "We first noticed a delay between freeze event occurrences and reported bearing acreage in Texas in 1984. This pattern was seen once again with grapefruit and oranges between 1989 and 1990. Therefore, for analyzing the causative factors behind the trends of bearing acreage over time, it seemed important to look at extreme temperature lows that occurred during the previous season. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Finding an Initial Model\n",
    "During our literature review, we happened upon [a 2010 article](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6550507.pdf) from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association that suggests that bearing acreage and yield for fresh grapefruit and oranges are partially dependent upon climate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the article presents the following models for bearing acreage and yield for fresh oranges and grapefruit, which we have summarized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Yield_t = f(Climate_t, Prices_{t - 1}, Technology_t, LandQuality_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Acreage_t = f(Acreage_{t - 1}, Acreage_{t - 2}, Climate_{t - 1}, Prices_{t - 1}, ...)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without focusing too much on the details, we noticed that both of these models include climate as an independent variable. We also noted that while the yield for a crop at timestep $t$ is dependent upon the climatic conditions at that same time step, the acreage is dependent upon the conditions at timestep $t - 1$, indicating a lag in the effects of climate on the bearing acreage of citrus crops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "For our modeling, we wanted to start with a big picture overview before deep diving into the granular elements, using scatterplots and linear regression of citrus bearing acreage with aggregated totals in the United States to start initital analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Practical Statistics for Data Scientists* emphasizes “by itself, the regression equation does not prove the direction of causation. Conclusions about causation must come from a broader context of understanding about the relationship.” For instance, nationally, there has been a noticeable decrease in bearing acreage for oranges, grapefruit, and lemons. in the past twenty years with a predicted decrease in the next five years. This answers the “what,” but further exploration of correlation is needed to discover the possibilities in the “why.”\n",

    "We wanted to analyze citrus disease as a potential contributing factor to the observed decline of citrus production over time. Unfortunately, finding fine-grain data related to citrus disease proliferation and distribution proved to be difficult. We attempted to use high humidity as a proxy for disease spread. While we did observe a moderate negative correlation between high humidity trends and bearing acreage across all three citrus crops, we acknowledge that using this proxy is bound to introduce a margin of error. Although there may be issues of statistical or scientific significance with this method, the data is still meaningful and worthy of future exploration."

    "# Lessons Learned\n",
    "* One Bite at a Time | Our scope was too large at the start and we lacked focus, which may have prevented us from moving as swiftly as we would have liked from the start. When completing a large-scale project, succinct phases are neccessary for success.\n",
    "* Ethics and Policy Can be Considered No Matter What Data Is Being Explored | Although we were looking at aggregated data on a large scale without record-level information, we can still think about implications of our findings in a broader social context. For example, if we found zero correlation between climate and crop yields, perhaps we would be supporting those who do not believe in climate change. If phase II of this study explores labor data and we state that migrant labor is absolutely necessary to support agriculture in the United States, it may bring up issues of immigration. \n",
    "* Compare Apples to Apples, Not Apples to Oranges | We realized that when working with time series data, it was important to be cognizant of the frequency and time intervals in which data points were collected. The agricultural data we pulled from the USDA was broken down by year whereas the weather data was in the form of hourly sensor readings. This made unifying the two data sets into a single yearly time series quite challenging. Planning time for matching variables is essential in the project planning process."

    "# Future Studies\n",

    "## Citrus Greening Disease\n",
    "By scanning news articles and scientific journals, we discovered that a significant portion of the decline of citrus production across the United States can be attributed to the introduction and subsequent spread of citrus greening disease, which is mediated by an insect known as the Asian Citrus Psyllid. Further exploration of the literature revealed that higher humidity trends are more conducive to the spread of citrus greening disease, vectored by the Asian Citrus Psyllid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Labor Data\n",
    "We also hypothesized that another factor that may contribute to the declining production of citrus over time is the potential decline in available agricultural laborers. Perhaps farms are scaling back their planted acreage in response to a reduced ability to meet labor demands to maintain crops. More research and data acquisition from the Bureau of Labor Statistics may provide further insights into this potential relationship."
